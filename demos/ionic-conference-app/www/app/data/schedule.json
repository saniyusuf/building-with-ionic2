            "description": "CSS Layout in 2016 is a mess of hacked together methods using techniques that were never designed for complex web and application layout. However change is in the air, brought to us by specifications such as CSS Grid Layout, Flexbox and the Box Alignment Module. In this session Rachel will introduce these specifications, explaining how they fit together to create a new system for layout.",

We present our experiences in search for the right abstractions and architecture optimized for change. We also elaborate on how selecting the React ecosystem for our stack improved our workflow and product quality, as well as examine problems we faced.issuu is a digital-publishing platform with offices in Copenhagen, Palo Alto, Calif., and Berlin.

But by leveraging knowlege of how the V8 JavaScript engine optimizes code, we can use this technique to write extremely fast data parsers, schema validators etc. In this talk we’ll learn how to write code that would make a mad scientist jealous, pushes V8 to eleven and make Christopher Nolan consider a sequel to Inception.",

            "description" : "So many frameworks! The javascript world seems to have an explosion of tools, a new one appears every other day with the promise of revolutionizing the way you program. We have seen the rise and fall of giants, but we are somehow not significantly more productive than before. What can we learn from our past and change in our present? Enter Elm. Elm is a programming language for the web with the unparalleled combination of speed and maintainability that the javascript world is so much looking forward to have. This talk talks is about the three major aspects of Elm and why I think it is leads the only sane step out of the chaos we are living in the frontend world: Elm as a language and how it can drastically change the maintainability issue for javascript apps; Elm as a architecture and how having clear guidelines that are enforced by the language is a good idea; and Elm as a fast growing ecosystem ",

            "location": "Kødbyen/Enghave Plads",
            "description": "Imagine you need a static website for a small website, a documentation or a corporate website. Why a static website? Because static is the new dynamic. It’s unhackable. It’s performant. And it has more to offer than you can imagine. But the thing is: you work with the React ecosystem and CSS Modules everyday and don’t want to write boring HTML templates and dangerous CSS selectors. You are a modern front-end developer and you don't really want to install Ruby or Python to build silly static HTML pages. You just want to use the tools you've grown to love. You want to get the same DX (developer experience) that React ecosystem offers you on a daily basis. You want to enjoy hot loading while you will work on your website. What if I told you that you could reuse all the unit tested React components that you will find on npm to make your isomorphic/universal static website? What if I told you that this website will be static but dynamic at the same time? What if I told you that you can even offer the UX of a progressive web app?",

This talk will aim to analytically showcase features of both versions, highlight where they stand in the evolution of the Ionic framework over time and also talk about when best to use each in the current climate. There will also be a brief highlight about the Ionic IO platform and all its new features like the Ionic Auth, Ionic Deploy & Ionic Push.",

If it is not, people will be less likely to love the app, or web or machine or whatever it is you are developing.There are a number of common design issues (traps) that can turn a good user experience into a bad one. In this talk we'll go through some of them and how you can use this knowledge to make sure your applications have awesome UIs.",

Only by learning through data can we improve our product and user experience. Nobody would ever deploy a backend service used by millions and not invest in measuring, monitoring and tracking user behaviour, performance and errors. Yet when the code runs on the browser, this is not unheard of.In this presentation we’ll focus on what, how, and why we’re measuring various metrics related to performance, quality, and feature usage in our javascript client code-base and how it helps us build a better product.issuu is a digital publishing platform that helps publishers get their content online and reach a world-wide audience. We currently have more than 27 million unique documents which are shown to over 100 million unique visitors every month.",
