# IONIC: THE EVOLUTION OF A HYBRID FRAMEWORK

Ionic is currently in its 3rd year of evolution and we are at a criss-cross point where 2 versions of the framework, Ionic V1 & Ionic V2, exist independently. This talk will aim to analytically showcase features of both versions, highlight where they stand in the evolution of the Ionic framework over time and also talk about when best to use each in the current climate. There will also be a brief highlight about the Ionic IO platform and all its new features like the Ionic Auth, Ionic Deploy & Ionic Push.
